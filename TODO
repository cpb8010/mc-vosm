1) use namespace "vo->sm->", rather than current "VO_" for every class
2) use "XML/YML" files to store trained data, rather than current '.txt" files.
3) 3D statistical models are not covered yet (tough to build up a 3D face database but this is to be done!)
4) documentations are still to be improved
