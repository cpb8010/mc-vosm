Release notes of VOSM.

--------------------------- Release 0.3.3 --May, 2012--------------------
Minor improvements are made in this version VOSM 0.3.3,
in order to be compatible with OpenCV 2.4.0 above.

1 General
   - VOSM 0.3.3 is based upon:
     
      a) Boost (>= 1.48) for file and directory operations
      b) OpenCV (2.4.0 or above)

   - VOSM 0.3.3 has been successfully tested on Boost 1.48 and OpenCV 2.4.0,
     both under Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 Professional.

   - Rename module "utils" in VOSM 0.3.2 to "common".

   - Add the following line in front of file VO_ShapeModel.h
          #include "opencv/cvaux.h"

   - Don't forget to link opencv_legacy.lib when building modules or tests
     based upon smbuilding.

   - In module "comalgs", all file names have been changed to begin with "VO_".

   - All files have been re-formated by the following 2 text rules
     "tab  -- 8 spaces"
     "insert tab with spaces"

   - All testing files used to begin with "vo_", for instance "vo_smbuilding" 
     are now renamed to begin with "test_".

   - The reason why in the license, version "0.4" is used instead of "0.3.4"
     is because version "0.4" is expected to be a major release.

due to prompt feedbacks from some VOSM users,
VOSM 0.3.1 is now released with the following improvements.

1 General
   - VOSM 0.3.1 is neither based on libgsl nor yaml-cpp any longer.
     The only 3rd party libraries that VOSM 0.3.1 is based upon are
     
      a) Boost (>= 1.34.1) for file and directory operations
      b) OpenCV (subervsion R3594 or above) as the basic but primary libraries 
         that VOSM 0.3.1 is built upon

   - A formal documentation is produced for reference

   - Add brief descriptions for every class


----------------------------- Release 0.3 --November, 2010--------------------

It has been a long time for Vision Open to release its recent 
research fruits related to ASM/AAMs.
VOSM 0.3 offers a thoroughly fresh coding implementations, 
and lots of improvements and new functionalities : 

1 General

  - Current VOSM can only be legally used under LGPL, namely,
	Lesser General Public License.

  - Current VOSM libraries requires CMake for configuration.

  - Changes in the set of supported platforms:

    - Fully supported by GNU g++ 4.5 and tested.

    - Well supported by Microsoft Windows Visual Studio 
	  C++ compiler 2008 (VC9). You may have to re-configure accordingly.

  - Changes in the set of supported OpenCV:

    - Must be OpenCV SVN R3594 or above 
	  (OpenCV 2.1 is too old to be compile with current VOSM 0.3)

2 Algorithms

  - Current VOSM affords 2D Profile ASM, which is dramatically faster
    than traditional 1D Profile ASM.

  - Current VOSM proposes a conceptual novel idea named as
    Active Feature Model.

  - Current VOSM implements all popular ASMs/AAMs,
    both for static images and dynamic videos, including:

	- 1D profile ASM

    - 2D profile ASM

    - Direct Local texture contrained (LTC) ASM

    - Basic AAM

    - ICIA(Inverse compositional image alignment) AAM

    - IAIA(Inverse additive image alignment) AAM

----------------------------- Release 0.2 -- April, 2008----------------------

Second release of "AAMBuilding":

    - No source, but a xwWidget based GUI application 
	  with some binary static libraries for model building.

----------------------------- Release 0.1 -- February, 2007-------------------

Initial release of "AAMBuilding", 

  	- Contains only the model building code.
