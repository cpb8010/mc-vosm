#  The VOSM CMake configuration file
#
#             ** File generated automatically, do not modify **
#
#  Usage from an external project: 
#    In your CMakeLists.txt, add these lines:
#
#    FIND_PACKAGE(VOSM REQUIRED )
#    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MY_TARGET_NAME ${VOSM_LIBS})   
#
#    This file will define the following variables:
#      - VOSM_LIBS          : The list of libraries to links against.
#      - VOSM_LIB_DIR       : The directory where lib files are. Calling LINK_DIRECTORIES
#                                with this path is NOT needed.
#      - VOSM_INCLUDE_DIRS  : The VOSM include directories.
#      - VOSM_VERSION       : The  version of this VOSM build. Example: "1.2.0"
#      - VOSM_VERSION_MAJOR : Major version part of VOSM_VERSION. Example: "1"
#      - VOSM_VERSION_MINOR : Minor version part of VOSM_VERSION. Example: "2"
#      - VOSM_VERSION_PATCH : Patch version part of VOSM_VERSION. Example: "0"
