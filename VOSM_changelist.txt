General
	Fixed numerous numeric type precision warnings through helper methods and static casts in VO_Common.h
        static_cast<int>
        static_cast<float>
		safeDoubleToFloat
		
	Added VO_Fitting2DSM::DrawMeshInfo class to move the drawing of points on the image outside of the timed fitting process; which should improve the reported fitting time with large images while recording fitting results
	
	Moved boost::filesystem calls to a helper method in VO_Common.h, this provides the same functionality with less duplicated code and allows OS specific filesystem methods to improve performance if necessary.
    
test_smfitting
    Changes
        YAML Config file can be used to specify call of the command line arguments
        Refactored fitting calls to reduce code duplication
        Loaded pyramid levels and profile dimensions/directions from saved model files
        
	
VO_FittingASMNDProfiles

	Changes
		Includes fittingTechnique specifier, an enum declared in VO_FittingASMNDProfiles.h
		
		VO_ASMNDProfileFitting - Added call to StagedPyramidFit to allow for different fitting techniques during fitting
		
		UpdateShape - Refactored to call FindBestOffset that selects the appropriate fitting technique.

	New
		VO_FindBestMatchingProfile2D - Checks 2 profiles per direction and chooses the profile with the smallest Mahalnobis distance.
		
		StagedPtramidFit - Chooses different techniques for different points in the pyramid fitting process (if applicable)
		
VO_RecognitionAlgs
	Changes
		CalcShapeFittingEffect - Per point distance calculations as 
	New
		SaveShapeResults - Improves SaveShapeRecogResults by calculating error per point and saving the given point placements, used for saving point updates after each iteration
		
		SaveFittingResults - More comprehensive SaveShapeResults that saves candidate locations and fitting time
		
VO_TextureModel.cpp
	New
		VO_CalcSubPixelTexture - Two channel texture calculation
		
VO_Profile
	New
		Set2DimProfile - Sets two channel mat with index
		
		Get2DProfileInMat4OneLandmark - Only supports 2 channel
				
	Changed
		Get1DProfileInMat4OneLandmark - Full hybrid, dual channel support
		
		GetNDProfiles4OneLandmark - Special case for 2 channels

VO_ASMNDProfies
	Changed
		VO_BuildASMNDProfiles - Two channels will produce 4 profiles
		
		VO_LoadProfileTrainingData - Takes an argument to control OpenCV imread functionality to load multi-channel images
		
VO_ASMLTCs
	Changed
		VO_HardSaveWaveletSingleChannelImage - prevented run from obvious bug in code, no functional solution.
