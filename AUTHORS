ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


YAO Wei
Great much thanks are given to Mr. Yao Wei for his help on the following several points:
1) I implemented 1D ASM Profile after I read Mr's Yao Wei's ASMLibrary in 2008.
   So, that's why his name appears as the first author in some functions 
   in file VO_FittingASMNDProfiles.cpp .
2) He helped to dramatically speed up my image warping function, namely,
   function VO_TextureModel::VO_LoadOneTextureFromShape in file VO_TextureModel.cpp .
   That's also why his name is listed as the 2nd author in file VO_TextureModel.cpp.
3) His two fabulous libraries, say ASMLibrary and AAMLibrary are partly built upon 
   my old version of statistical models, say, "aambuilding".
4) He did some further research in statistical models that I'm not familiar with,
   which, I believe, enables him to be one of the best researchers in statistical models
   for computer vision.
